# SLOs, SLIs, Dashboards, and Alerts

The critical user journey is checkout: client request through gateway, Orders, Inventory, Payments, Kafka event publication, and final order confirmation.

## Checkout SLOs

| SLO | Target | SLI | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checkout success rate | 99.0% over 30 days | Successful confirmed checkouts / valid checkout attempts | Orders emits terminal status metrics by result. |
| Checkout latency | 95% of successful checkouts complete within 2 seconds over 30 days | Duration from `POST /api/orders` accepted to confirmed/failed terminal status | Distributed trace span and Orders histogram. |
| Checkout acceptance latency | 99% of `POST /api/orders` responses return within 300 ms | HTTP server duration at gateway and Orders | Gateway and Orders RED metrics. |
| Notification degradation | 99.9% of successful checkout requests must not fail because Notifications is unavailable | Checkout failures attributed to Notifications / checkout attempts | Orders failure reason metric. |

## Error Budget

- Checkout success-rate error budget: 1.0% failed valid checkout attempts per 30 days.
- Burn-rate alerts must page on user-visible symptoms, not CPU usage alone.
- A release is paused or rolled back if the Orders canary consumes more than 10% of the daily error budget during the canary window.

## Dashboards

- **Money Path RED:** request rate, error rate, and duration for gateway, Orders, Inventory, and Payments.
- **Kafka Pipeline:** consumer lag, produced/consumed event counts, duplicate events, dead-letter count.
- **Inventory Correctness:** hold attempts, successful holds, rejected holds, expired holds, duplicate idempotency hits, oversell invariant violations.
- **Payment Safety:** authorization attempts, duplicate idempotency hits, declines, retry count, circuit-breaker state.
- **Infrastructure USE/Golden Signals:** CPU, memory, network, disk, pod restarts, saturation, and dependency health.

## Alerts

| Alert | Trigger | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CheckoutFastBurn | Checkout success-rate SLO burns fast for 10 minutes | Users cannot complete purchases. |
| CheckoutSlowBurn | Checkout success-rate SLO burns slowly for 1 hour | Persistent degradation needs investigation. |
| CheckoutLatencyHigh | p95 checkout latency above 2 seconds for 15 minutes | Critical path is slower than the stated SLO. |
| PaymentCircuitOpen | Orders payment circuit breaker remains open for 5 minutes | Payment dependency is failing or overloaded. |
| InventoryReservationFailures | Reservation failure ratio spikes without matching sold-out signals | Possible inventory consistency or database issue. |
| KafkaPipelineStalled | Order pipeline consumer lag grows for 15 minutes | Async confirmation/notification is not converging. |

## Tracing

Every checkout trace must include:

- Gateway inbound request span.
- Orders acceptance span.
- Inventory hold/reservation span.
- Payments authorization span.
- Kafka publish spans for order/payment/notification events.
- Consumer spans for asynchronous stages.

The required presentation question is: "Where did this order spend its time, and where did it fail?"
