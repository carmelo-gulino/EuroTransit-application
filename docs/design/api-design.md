# EuroTransit API and Service Design

This document defines the service boundaries and communication contracts for EuroTransit. The design intentionally separates synchronous decisions that must be made during checkout from asynchronous work that can be retried, observed, and recovered through Kafka.

For the rationale behind the selected consistency, money-path, and delivery decisions, see [architecture-decisions.md](architecture-decisions.md).

## Security Boundary

EuroTransit is designed as an enterprise-grade system. Public APIs must assume an authenticated user identity. Local development may use fixed development JWTs or a mock OIDC issuer, but the cluster/proof target uses Keycloak as the OIDC identity provider.

- Traefik is the only north-south entry point and terminates TLS in the cluster environment.
- Public APIs expect OAuth2/OIDC bearer JWTs. Tokens must carry a stable subject (`sub`), tenant or organization context when applicable, and role/scope claims.
- Services treat the JWT `sub` claim as the authoritative `principalId`. The `email` claim is optional metadata for display or delivery and must not be used as the ownership key.
- The production-like cluster target uses Keycloak for OIDC. Mock identity providers and fixed JWTs are local-development substitutes only.
- Customer-facing write APIs, especially checkout, require an authenticated customer identity.
- `GET /api/orders/{orderId}` must only return orders owned by the authenticated customer, unless the caller has an operational/admin role. Customer-to-customer access returns `404 Not Found` so the API does not reveal that another customer's order exists.
- Inventory and Payments APIs are internal service-to-service APIs and are not exposed directly to public clients.
- Service-to-service requests must propagate correlation IDs, the authenticated principal where required, and a trusted service identity. The production target should use mTLS or an equivalent workload-identity control.
- Gateway authentication is not a substitute for service-level authorization. Each service must enforce local ownership, role, and scope decisions for resources it owns.
- Money-path actions must emit audit-ready logs with correlation ID, principal ID, order ID, and outcome. Logs must not contain bearer tokens, secrets, raw payment data, or card details.
- Secrets such as database credentials, signing keys, and payment-provider credentials belong in the configuration repository as SealedSecrets, not in application source.

### Endpoint Security Summary

| Endpoint Group | Exposure | Authentication | Authorization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/catalog/**` | Public or authenticated depending on offer visibility | Optional for public catalog; required for personalized offers | Public read or customer scope |
| `POST /api/orders` | External | Required | Customer scope; principal becomes order owner |
| `GET /api/orders/{orderId}` | External | Required | Order owner or privileged operations scope |
| `POST /api/inventory/reservations` | Internal | Required service credential plus propagated user context | Orders service only; order owner context required |
| `DELETE /api/inventory/reservations/{reservationId}` | Internal | Required service credential plus propagated user context | Orders service only; compensation for owned order |
| `POST /api/payments/authorize` | Internal | Required service credential plus propagated user context | Orders service only; payment belongs to owned order |
| `GET /api/notifications` | External | Required | Authenticated customer can read only their own notifications |
| `GET /api/notifications/stream` | External | Required | Authenticated customer can receive only their own live notification events |

## Shared Request Headers

| Header | Required On | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | Protected external APIs and internal service calls according to the endpoint security summary | Carries a bearer JWT for public APIs or service identity for internal calls. |
| `X-User-Id` | Internal service-to-service calls (e.g. `POST /api/inventory/reservations`) | Explicitly propagates the original customer identity when the `Authorization` header carries a service account token instead of the user token. |
| `X-Correlation-Id` | All internal calls, logs, and Kafka events | Public clients may provide it; the gateway generates one if absent; services must propagate it unchanged through one checkout flow. |
| `Idempotency-Key` | `POST /api/orders`, `POST /api/inventory/reservations`, `POST /api/payments/authorize` | Identifies one mutating attempt. It is not an authorization credential and must be scoped with caller/user context, operation, and request fingerprint. |

Idempotency keys are generated at the caller boundary for the operation they protect:

- Public clients generate a new high-entropy `Idempotency-Key` before calling `POST /api/orders`.
- Public clients reuse that key only for retries of the same checkout attempt.
- A new checkout attempt uses a new key, even if the request payload is identical.
- Orders consumes the public checkout key and stores it with `principalId`, operation, request fingerprint, and result.
- Orders generates separate downstream keys for internal operations, for example `invres_{orderId}_v1` and `payauth_{orderId}_v1`.
- Inventory and Payments store their received keys scoped by operation, service caller/user context where applicable, request fingerprint, and result.
- Reusing the same key with the same logical payload returns the original logical result.
- Reusing the same key with a different logical payload returns `409 Conflict`.

Idempotency retention is service-specific:

| Service | Operation | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orders | Checkout/order placement | 24 hours |
| Inventory | Seat reservation | 30 minutes |
| Payments | Payment authorization | 24 hours |

Inventory seat holds last 10 minutes. The 30-minute Inventory idempotency retention remembers the reservation attempt but does not extend or renew the seat hold; retrying the same key after expiration returns the original expired reservation result instead of creating a new hold.

## Service Boundaries

| Service | Responsibility | Interaction Style | Why this boundary exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog | Exposes routes, schedules, products, and offers. | Synchronous read API. | Catalog is read-heavy and tolerant of stale data, so it can be scaled and deployed independently from checkout. |
| Orders | Owns the customer-facing purchase workflow, order state, idempotent checkout acceptance, and its PostgreSQL database. | Synchronous entry API plus asynchronous pipeline orchestration. | Orders is the money-path coordinator: it accepts checkout requests quickly and records/reports order progress. |
| Inventory | Owns finite seat availability and time-limited seat holds. | Synchronous hold decision plus reservation events. | Inventory is the contended resource. It must create one strongly consistent hold before a seat can proceed to payment. Its reservation store is separate from Orders' order-state ownership. |
| Payments | Owns payment authorization state and integrates with a provider sandbox/test API. | Synchronous idempotent authorization plus payment events. | Payment authorization must not double-charge under retries; an immediate success/failure decision is needed before order confirmation. |
| Notifications | Sends confirmations and customer updates. | Fully asynchronous event consumer. | Notification failure must not fail checkout. Kafka buffers the work until the service recovers. |

## Datastore Ownership

Orders, Inventory, and Payments use separate logical PostgreSQL databases with separate credentials:

- Orders owns `orders_db`.
- Inventory owns `inventory_db`.
- Payments owns `payments_db`.
- Each service owns its own tables, migrations, idempotency records, and credentials.
- Services must not read, join, or mutate another service's database directly.
- Cross-service coordination happens through the approved HTTP APIs and Kafka events.
- A shared PostgreSQL cluster is acceptable for local/proof environments, but logical databases and credentials remain separate.

## Public APIs

### Catalog

- `GET /api/catalog/routes`
  - Lists available routes and schedules. Public data may be served without authentication; personalized pricing requires an authenticated user.
- `GET /api/catalog/routes/{routeId}`
  - Returns details for one route.
- `GET /api/catalog/offers`
  - Lists currently available pricing and ticket offers. Personalized offers require a customer principal.

### Orders

- `POST /api/orders`
  - Accepts a checkout request.
  - Requires an authenticated customer identity.
  - Returns `202 Accepted` with an `orderId` and initial status after the request has been accepted for processing.
  - Requires a public-client-generated `Idempotency-Key` so client retries do not create duplicate orders.
  - Stores checkout idempotency records for 24 hours.
- `GET /api/orders/{orderId}`
  - Returns the current order status: accepted, reserving, payment-pending, confirmed, failed, or cancelled.
  - Requires the authenticated customer to own the order, unless an operator/admin role is used.
  - Returns `404 Not Found` for customer-to-customer access to avoid revealing another customer's order.
- Orders persists order state in `orders_db`.

### Inventory

- `POST /api/inventory/reservations`
  - Attempts to create a 10-minute hold for the requested seats.
  - Internal API; callers must be trusted services such as Orders.
  - Requires an Orders-generated idempotency key derived from the order id, operation, and attempt.
  - Uses a strong consistency decision: the same seat cannot have two active holds.
  - Stores reservation idempotency records for 30 minutes without extending the 10-minute hold.
  - Owns reservation/seat availability state for the no-oversell invariant; this does not replace Orders' ownership of the order-state database.
- `DELETE /api/inventory/reservations/{reservationId}`
  - Releases a hold when payment fails, the order is cancelled, or the 10-minute hold expires.
  - Is idempotent by reservation state and does not require an `Idempotency-Key`.

### Payments

- `POST /api/payments/authorize`
  - Authorizes payment for one order.
  - Internal API; callers must be trusted services such as Orders.
  - Requires an Orders-generated idempotency key so retries return the original authorization result instead of charging again.
  - Stores payment authorization idempotency records for 24 hours.
  - Calls a configured provider sandbox/test API through a Payments-owned adapter; raw card data and live charges are out of scope.
  - Accepts only payment method tokens or provider references, never raw card number, CVV, or live payment credentials.

### Notifications

- The service consumes events and sends or records email/SMS confirmations and failure updates.
- `GET /api/notifications`
  - Returns the authenticated customer's notification history.
  - Requires a normal bearer JWT and only returns notifications owned by the authenticated principal.
- `GET /api/notifications/stream`
  - Exposes live notification updates to the frontend using Server-Sent Events with `text/event-stream`.
  - Sends only notifications owned by the authenticated principal.
  - Is an enhancement over the stored notification history; if the stream disconnects, the frontend can fall back to `GET /api/notifications`.

## Kafka Events

Events use a common envelope. `schemaVersion` is the version of the event schema for the given `eventType`, not an order version or service version.

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_123",
  "eventType": "order-confirmed",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "occurredAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00Z",
  "correlationId": "corr_123",
  "orderId": "ord_123",
  "principalId": "customer_789",
  "payload": {}
}
```

Consumers must be idempotent because Kafka delivery is treated as at-least-once. Events must not contain bearer tokens, provider secrets, raw payment data, card details, or plaintext credentials.

| Event | Producer | Consumers | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `order-placed` | Orders | Orders pipeline observers, optional analytics | Durable record that checkout was accepted. |
| `inventory-reserved` | Inventory | Orders | Indicates that the requested seats are held for 10 minutes and can proceed to payment. |
| `inventory-failed` | Inventory | Orders | Indicates that the hold failed and the order must not proceed to payment. |
| `payment-authorized` | Payments | Orders | Indicates payment authorization succeeded. |
| `payment-declined` | Payments | Orders | Indicates payment failed and compensation may be needed. |
| `order-confirmed` | Orders | Notifications, observability consumers | Indicates the order is complete and customer notification can be sent. |
| `notification-requested` | Orders | Notifications | Optional explicit notification command if separated from `order-confirmed`. |

## Error Model

All services use a shared HTTP status mapping:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | Malformed request or required header missing |
| `401` | Missing or invalid authentication |
| `403` | Authenticated but not authorized |
| `404` | Resource missing or intentionally not visible |
| `409` | Idempotency conflict, reservation conflict, or incompatible state transition |
| `422` | Valid request shape but invalid business action |
| `503` | Dependency unavailable, provider unavailable, or circuit breaker open |

Error responses use structured JSON:

```json
{
  "code": "IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT",
  "message": "Idempotency key was reused with a different request",
  "correlationId": "corr_123"
}
```

Validation errors may add a machine-readable `details` object, but `code`, `message`, and `correlationId` remain mandatory.

## Money Path

The selected money path is hybrid sync+async:

1. Client submits `POST /api/orders` with a public-client-generated `Idempotency-Key`.
2. Orders validates the request, stores an accepted order, emits `order-placed`, and returns `202 Accepted`.
3. Orders executes the reservation/payment pipeline with Kotlin coroutines/flows and structured cancellation.
4. Orders calls Inventory synchronously with an Orders-generated reservation idempotency key to create a 10-minute seat hold because this is the consistency boundary.
5. Orders calls Payments synchronously with an Orders-generated payment idempotency key only after the hold succeeds, because payment must be idempotent and immediately known before confirmation.
6. Orders emits final events such as `order-confirmed` and `notification-requested`.
7. Notifications consumes events asynchronously; if it is down, checkout remains successful and Kafka retains the work.

## Resilience Requirements

- All synchronous service calls must have timeouts, bounded retries with backoff/jitter, circuit breakers, and bulkheads.
- Orders must flip readiness to refuse new traffic during shutdown while in-flight coroutine work drains or is cancelled cooperatively.
- Inventory and Payments must persist idempotency records so duplicate events or HTTP retries return the same outcome.
- Orders persists checkout idempotency records for 24 hours, Inventory persists reservation idempotency records for 30 minutes, and Payments persists authorization idempotency records for 24 hours.
- Inventory holds must expire after 10 minutes if payment does not complete, returning the seat to available state. Inventory idempotency retention must not renew an expired hold.
- Notification failure is a degraded mode, not a checkout failure.
- The checkout SLOs, alerts, and tracing requirements are defined in [slo-observability.md](../operations/slo-observability.md).
